About MCCBT
-----------
MCCBT parses the input bindings from GameUserSettings.ini to be human-readable
and writes arbitrary bindings to a new config file, bypassing Halo MCC's input
binding rules. While this does not necessarily fix all of MCC's action set
quirks (for example, binding Melee and Secondary Fire to a single button in
Halo 3 still breaks dual wielding), it does at least give you a chance to try
some bindings out in case they do happen to work by coincidence (the previous
example mentioned doesn't work for Halo 3, but does work for Halo 2 Classic).

Dependencies
------------
MCCBT depends solely on SDL2. MCCBT never explicitly uses the C runtime.

Building MCCBT
--------------
Just type 'make'! You can set $CC to cross-compile.
